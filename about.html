                        <p class="st-regular-font">Our organisation is a close-knit group and each member has an important role to play in our projects. </p>

                        <p class="st-regular-font">Simon and Tina are the Artistic and Creative Directors - their job is to listen to and record the stories, write a script and then work with the children to bring their stories to life on the stage.</p>

                        <p class="st-regular-font">Amelie and Sam join in the workshops, establish friendships with the children and become a link between their parents as teachers and the kids as learners. </p>

                                <p>Simon has been making theatre for 30 years. His love of theatre began in Sydney where he studied with NIDA. He then moved to London and studied Expressive Mime with Adam Darius and Theatre Performance at the London Academy Drama School. After living and performing in London for three years, Simon returned to Australia where he became a founding member of the Chapel of Change theatre company based in Melbourne with Rainsford. He then moved to Germany and founded Footslog English Language Theatre which toured various shows throughout Europe for many years until he relocated to Australia. Simon and Tina founded The Storey Players (TSP Theatre Inc) when they realized there was a great need for drama activities in remote communities of Australia. </p>

                                <p>Don Rowlands OAM, is a leader and respected Elder of the Wangkangurru people and Head Ranger of Munga-Thirri National Park (Simpson Desert). He was born in Munga-Thirri where he learnt the beliefs, traditions and cultures of the Wangkangurru from his Elders. He also learnt how to track, hunt and find bush tucker. His grandmother taught him how to understand the Dreamtime and how these narratives spiritually bonded the Wangkangurru people to the Munga-Thirri.</p>
                                <p>Don is a strong proponent of “the ways of the old people”, with a sincere belief that all Australians can benefit enormously from developing an understanding of their country by appreciating the culture and beliefs that sustained the Indigenous people of Australia for thousands of years. He believes that one practical way to do this is by sharing the knowledge of survival and the benefits of coexisting with the land. Don hopes that by promoting attention to the positive aspects of respecting and nurturing the ancient cultures of his people, a deeper understanding can be developed between all Australians.</p>

She is now living in the Northern Suburbs of Brisbane and works in her community with local Aboriginal Elders. She also works alongside her father Don within the family organisation ‘Watti Watti Custodial Services Pty Ltd’ whose main emphasis is to ‘Strengthen cultural identity and to educate and share knowledge of traditional stories, culture and language in a way that is respectful, factual and educational.’</p>

                                <p>Trevina lives in a small country town call Dajarra that is situated 155 km south of Mt Isa which, at one stage was one of the largest cattle droving centres in the world. Trevina is a proud Pitta Pitta/ Wangka-madlha woman and a mother of five boys and one girl. With her husband, Gary, they manage a small hobby farm with goats, horses and cows. Since she was young, Trevina has worked on stations in remote areas within Outback North West Qld and is full of stories about the excitement of that era. She especially loves doing activities with the children at Dajarra and Boulia State School. Trevina is an Artist and loves to sew, take photos and cook - catering for large groups is her speciality. She also loves going out on Country, collecting bush medicine/food and teaching cultural awareness.</p>
